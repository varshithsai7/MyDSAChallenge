GENERIC TREE
parent->children

root node is the start node from its branches children generate and it gos on

BINARYTREE

only maximum 2 children are possible
left and right
or can be 0 or can be 1

there are levels
height=total levels/total depth/distance from start root to deepest point possible

subtree is small part of the tree

solve(root){
    solve(leftsub)
    solve(rightsub)
    calculate solution
}
